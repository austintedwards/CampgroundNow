    <h2>My Past Four Years</h2>
    <p style="font-family:arial">	 After graduating from CU Boulder with engineer, I moved to Hawaii to work in mechanical contracting.  I did that for about four years before I returned to Denver.  In Denver, I continued that job for about a year and a half before I got let go.  During my unemployment, I took the time to decide what would be my career change.  I always knew I wanted a change but didn't know what that would be until I discovered this Galvanize program.</p>
    <p style="font-family:arial"> This program is the beginning of something new.  As a subcontractor, I did not enjoy when any issue or task that needed to be done had to go through the GC.  I like working with everyone involved like the engineer, desginer, owner, other trades, etc.  We were able to work with them but only through the GC and still would be upset if notified.  This really made me want to work with a clinet base company.  Somewhere where it is one on one.  During my job search, this is where I keep coming across programming positions that I wanted but could not get.  Now I am here to make that change. </p>
<p style="font-family:arial"> I am excited to do this program and then become a junior programer somwhere.  I would love to eventually work for a travel or recreational company.  What excites me the most is programming is just growing.  Every business needs an online presence and I am ready to discover all those new opportunities.  Hopefully, use my own idea to create my own website and business. </p>
